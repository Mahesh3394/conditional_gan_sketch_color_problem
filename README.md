# Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN)

## Overview:

This repository contains an implementation of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN), a variant of the popular Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). cGANs extend the basic GAN framework by introducing conditional information to the generator and discriminator. This allows for more controlled and targeted generation of synthetic data.

## What are Conditional GANs?

Conditional GANs are an extension of GANs that incorporate additional information, known as conditioning, into the training process. In a standard GAN, the generator takes random noise as input and produces synthetic data, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and fake data. In a cGAN, both the generator and discriminator receive additional conditioning information, which can be used to guide the generation process.

## Key Components:

- Generator (G): Takes random noise and conditioning information as input and generates synthetic data.
- Discriminator (D): Receives real or synthetic data along with conditioning information and classifies the input as real or fake.
- Conditional Information: This is the additional information provided to both the generator and discriminator to guide the generation process. It could be class labels, attribute information, or any other relevant data.
